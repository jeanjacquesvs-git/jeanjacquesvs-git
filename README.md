Coin Swap Search AI is a heuristic-based state-space search puzzle that rearranges colored coins into a goal configuration using valid slide and jump moves. Built with Java, this project demonstrates my ability to model problems as search spaces, design admissible heuristics, and implement priority-based search algorithms.
You can check out the repository here.

## Skills demonstrated:

State-space modeling

Heuristic design

Search algorithms

Algorithmic problem solving

Java programming
